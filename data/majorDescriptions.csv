Tell us a little about yourself My name is Kia, and I am a senior at UW-Stout. Throughout my years at Stout, my experience has been great! The professors genuinely care about their students and want them to succeed. Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor? I chose to become a Spanish Minor for several reasons. I have always had an interest in Latin culture and thought Spanish was such a beautiful language. It is also one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. As a retail major, being bilingual is super beneficial and can open many doors for you. Did you travel abroad during your years at UW-Stout? I chose to study abroad for an academic year in Puebla, Mexico to improve my Spanish speaking skills. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made! Mexico is a gorgeous, geographically diverse country with a rich history. While I was there, I traveled throughout the country – from the desert in the north to the rainforest in the south. I was lucky enough to experience the culture outside of the tourist traps and I got to meet some great people along the way. What has learning a language deeply meant to you? What are some soft skills that you gained from learning Spanish? I learned a lot about myself and developed new skills through my Spanish language journey and study abroad. The best skills that I have gained from my experience is my ability to push myself out of my comfort zone and adapt to new environments. In my opinion, having the ability to push yourself out of your comfort zone is one of the best things you can do for yourself. I feel that it prepares you to be more resilient when faced with adversity. What are your plans for the future? My hope for my future is to move abroad for a while and gain experience in a foreign retail setting. I think it would be fun to experience a new culture outside of a university and to be able to live abroad for longer than an academic year. It is nerve-racking to think about, but I am confident that my foreign language experience and study abroad has prepared me for this new journey! Tell us a little about yourself. I graduated from UW-Stout in the Spring of 2020, with a degree in Business Administration and minors in Project Management and Spanish. I recently moved to Northern MN, a big change from my hometown, St. Paul, MN, to start my career as a business consultant for a non-profit economic development corporation. Tell us about your experience at UW-Stout. My experience was something I will always remember. I was involved in Greek life, worked on campus, volunteered and did fundraisers.

Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor? I have been learning Spanish since I was 6 years old. I have always had a drive and passion to learn more about the culture the language flourishes in. Additionally, it has been something that has challenged me as well as helped me open my eyes. It is customary in many countries to learn a second language with proficiency, so why not ours? Finally, the professors in the program at UW-Stout have been nothing short of great in the way they teach and care for students' progression. Did you travel abroad during your years at UW-Stout? In the Summer of 2018, I traveled alone to San Isidrol, Costa Rica for a month to volunteer doing project management. In the Summer of 2019, I traveled with Kevin Anzzolin and a handful of other students to Oaxaca, Mexico to learn about business and Spanish. What has learning a language deeply meant to you? What are some soft skills that you gained from learning Spanish? Learning a language means understanding a whole new demographic of people. We are limited to what we know and the knowledge to communicate in another language opens many doors. It is about humanity, understanding, empathy, and of course, new adventures. I have learned how to effectively communicate with other cultures, my emotional intelligence has progressed, and my confidence has been nothing short of what I want it to be. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us? Spanish is a language that can open doors in many ways. There is a lot to gain from not only the language, but those who speak it. I was fortunate enough to have a solid core at UW-Stout in the Spanish. If you want to learn another language, I would recommend taking Spanish courses at Stout. Tell us a little about yourself.

Since I was involved in various groups, I really enjoyed making connections with students and faculty of different cultural backgrounds. Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor?

Persons working with these older people might be providing educational opportunities, recreation and leisure programs,  and volunteer activities. Some older persons are frail and less active. Jobs which relate to these more vulnerable elders might be in long-term care, health care settings or agencies that deliver services to older persons. The relative newness of the field means that there are opportunities for innovative ideas, new programs and products.” The Gerontology Certificate is relevant to a wide-range of careers and job titles interested in upskilling in this area.
