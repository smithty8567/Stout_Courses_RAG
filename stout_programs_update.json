Applied Social Science Economics Concentration will give you concrete analytical skills that are in high demand in business, government, and non-profit sectors. Economics is the study of decision making. It’s the study of people and systems interacting to use resources in the best ways possible. This can mean combining inputs to maximize profits or working toward policies that encourage long-run sustainability. Economics often involves topics like prices, business, and finance, but it’s not all about money. Economists are just as likely to study the environment, the health care system, or professional sports. Economics is a broad discipline that helps us understand historical trends, interpret today’s headlines, and make predictions about the future. If you are interested in understanding how the world around you works, why people make the decisions they make, and how you can harness data to answer questions about the real world then economics might be for you. The American Economics Association page for students provides information about the field, jobs, and research. View the concentration plan, credit requirements and course descriptions. Loading... The Economics concentration can be combined with a variety of minors that will set you apart in the job market: \"What I enjoyed most about being a student at UW-Stout was the polytechnic aspect. Being able to learn hands-on in small class sizes allowed me to make connections with my peers and professors.\" All students complete independent research to learn data collection and analysis techniques used across industries and in government and non-profit settings. You will learn how to clearly summarize and present results to use in decision making no matter what area of the economy you choose to work. Economics concentration students go on to a wide variety of careers.  Economists can work as government advisors, legal consultants, and private sector employees. Using theoretical models or empirical data, they evaluate programs, study human behavior, and explain social phenomena. Their contributions inform everything from public policy to household or business decisions. Economists tend to have high starting salaries as well as excellent advancement opportunities.",

The digitization of communications has created a fundamental switch that places technology at the heart of the process of marketing communications. New careers are emerging, and few people possess the required educational background to thrive in this new field. Digital marketing technology falls broadly into the field of “Informatics,” which is the study of how users and systems interact to accomplish goals. The program takes a multidisciplinary approach featuring content, design, development, and distribution. The heart of the curriculum is in areas of web technology and enterprise technology systems. Courses in software and web applications, marketing, design, production, and analytics provide a cross-disciplinary approach to prepare students for a broad range of careers where the job titles are just emerging and will be constantly changing and growing in the foreseeable future. Businesses realize the importance of hiring people who understand both process and technology, which results in a hot job market where talent is limited, jobs are abundant, and salaries are high.  This program prepares students for this job market and to grow as it changes.

UW-Stout graduates work in various creative roles at design firms nationally and internationally. The success of our students is derived from a program that highlights the intersections of fine art, design, history, sustainability and a strong liberal arts education. Developing the ability and knowledge to communicate using digital/technical communication systems and processes while understanding social, psychological and economic implications in relation to a variety of clients and design situations is a central objective of this program. Students will acquire “hands on” experience using industry standard tools, software and creative techniques, and are encouraged to participate in research projects, co-ops or study abroad programs. A required mid-program portfolio review offers graphic design and interactive media students an assessment of their progress in foundation art and design courses. Extensive library resources and the art and design department visual resource center are significant assets. A 2.0 overall grade point average and a 2.5 or better in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts and the Department of Design courses (ART/ARTH/DES/GDD) is required to complete this Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. An experiential learning component is required of all graduates of the BFA in Graphic Design and Interactive Media program, and may be successfully completed by participating in a co-op, internship, international study program, field experience or sponsored project.

    "text": "Go to program website Academic Requirements Entrance into the Honors College Students are accepted into the Honors College in one of two ways: being invited to join based on high academic achievement or by applying using the application form on this website. Students from a wide range of academic experiences are encouraged to apply and have successfully completed the college’s requirements. Honors Units Honors College students complete eight honors units during their time at Stout. Honors units include an exciting variety of course offerings each semester, study abroad opportunities, and Honors Contracts. Courses: We have a rich variety of courses in every general education category. Students earn general education credits by taking honors courses in place of regular classes. Students read primary source materials rather than textbooks and discussion-based classes are centered on important questions. Students must earn a grade of B or better in a course in order to earn one honors unit. A three credit course will count as one honors unit. Once in a student’s career, a four or five credit course will earn two honors units, with a grade of B or better. Contracts: Honors College students must complete at least one Honors Contract prior to graduation. Successful completion of a contract earns a student one honors unit. To complete a contract, students meet with a faculty mentor to design and accomplish a project that interests them and that adds depth or breadth to their study. Students work with their mentor to complete a substantial project equivalent to approximately 60 hours of work. The student may complete no more than two Honors Contracts in a single academic area. Capstone: The Honors Capstone is a two-unit option for senior-level students. This is a major interdisciplinary research project that may build upon a capstone in the major. It requires at least 120 hours of work. Capstone projects are encouraged but not required. Study Abroad Opportunities: Students who study abroad for a semester, summer session or WinTerM, and receive a B or better in at least one course of study, will earn one honors unit. Students who study abroad for a full year, and earn B or better in at least one course per semester abroad, will receive two honors units. Study abroad is encouraged but not required. Honors Colloquia Each semester all honors students in the college consider an issue and read a related text. Readings are done independently and a date is set for the whole of the Honors College student body to meet to discuss the topic in small groups.

For more information and how to apply, see our Accelerated Programs (UG+GR) information page . Introduction The Bachelor of Science degree program in Manufacturing Engineering is designed to prepare engineers as experts in the production process, from design through manufacturing. As a team member, the manufacturing engineer works with other professionals in the design of products, particularly from the point of view of the efficiency of production. They are responsible for selecting the right materials for various product applications and for determining methods used in processing raw materials into finished products. Using computers, they design and control automated systems capable of rapidly making the product. Manufacturing Engineers are part of the company’s management team and make important decisions regarding production planning, inventory, scheduling and quality. Through intensive hands-on laboratory experience, which is the heart of UW-Stout’s teaching strategy, the program emphasizes application of theory to solution of real world problems. Manufacturing Engineering students learn modern production tools, such as computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), robotics, programmable logic controllers, computer simulation of production environment and modern manufacturing management techniques. Students have opportunities to function as members of production teams as they practice concurrent product design, material selection, appropriate manufacturing method selection, and automated production systems design. The UW-Stout Manufacturing Engineering degree is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. It is the only nationally accredited manufacturing engineering degree in Wisconsin. There are many opportunities for cooperative learning and internship experiences with regional companies, providing industrial experience and that extra “edge” when applying for jobs upon graduation.

Introduction A packaging career today requires a thorough knowledge of materials, methods, design concepts, marketing, logistics, regulations, standards, test methods, environment, user interface, and machinery to develop and produce the packages that protect and preserve a product, help market the product and instruct the consumer in its proper use. UW-Stout’s Bachelor of Science degree program in Packaging prepares students for technical or management responsibilities in the packaging industry to meet these needs. The program places strong emphasis on the application of theory to strengthen problem solving abilities and challenges students by providing opportunities to solve “real” packaging industry problems in classroom/laboratory settings. The trend in the packaging industry is to hire employees who can function in more than one area at career entry. UW-Stout’s Packaging program recognizes this trend by offering the student several “emphasis” options which include course and laboratory work beyond the technical core of the program. With the quantity and variety of products produced in the world, it is easy to understand that packaging is a dynamic multibillion dollar industry in need of well-educated professionals. Graduates of the program are positioned advantageously for entry into the expanding and evolving packaging industry, as well as for further studies in the field of packaging.

Property management is the administration, operation, marketing, and maintenance of real property in order to achieve the objectives of the property’s owner. Property managers are in a service business and work closely with both the owners of the properties they manage and the tenants and residents who reside and work within these properties. The field of property management is growing steadily because of three concurrent trends: (1) the simultaneous growth of the population and its requirements for space has increased the total number of all types of buildings, (2) a larger percentage of real estate is considered investment property and (3) there is increasingly wide acceptance of the fact that real estate management requires special training and education.

Tell us a little about yourself My name is Kia, and I am a senior at UW-Stout. Throughout my years at Stout, my experience has been great! The professors genuinely care about their students and want them to succeed. Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor? I chose to become a Spanish Minor for several reasons. I have always had an interest in Latin culture and thought Spanish was such a beautiful language. It is also one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. As a retail major, being bilingual is super beneficial and can open many doors for you. Did you travel abroad during your years at UW-Stout? I chose to study abroad for an academic year in Puebla, Mexico to improve my Spanish speaking skills. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made! Mexico is a gorgeous, geographically diverse country with a rich history. While I was there, I traveled throughout the country – from the desert in the north to the rainforest in the south. I was lucky enough to experience the culture outside of the tourist traps and I got to meet some great people along the way. What has learning a language deeply meant to you? What are some soft skills that you gained from learning Spanish? I learned a lot about myself and developed new skills through my Spanish language journey and study abroad. The best skills that I have gained from my experience is my ability to push myself out of my comfort zone and adapt to new environments. In my opinion, having the ability to push yourself out of your comfort zone is one of the best things you can do for yourself. I feel that it prepares you to be more resilient when faced with adversity. What are your plans for the future? My hope for my future is to move abroad for a while and gain experience in a foreign retail setting. I think it would be fun to experience a new culture outside of a university and to be able to live abroad for longer than an academic year. It is nerve-racking to think about, but I am confident that my foreign language experience and study abroad has prepared me for this new journey! Tell us a little about yourself. I graduated from UW-Stout in the Spring of 2020, with a degree in Business Administration and minors in Project Management and Spanish. I recently moved to Northern MN, a big change from my hometown, St. Paul, MN, to start my career as a business consultant for a non-profit economic development corporation. Tell us about your experience at UW-Stout. My experience was something I will always remember. I was involved in Greek life, worked on campus, volunteered and did fundraisers. I was fortunate enough to keep my schooling to a 4-year timeline and graduated accordingly. I learned a lot about being yourself and not shying away from new adventures. Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor? I have been learning Spanish since I was 6 years old. I have always had a drive and passion to learn more about the culture the language flourishes in. Additionally, it has been something that has challenged me as well as helped me open my eyes. It is customary in many countries to learn a second language with proficiency, so why not ours? Finally, the professors in the program at UW-Stout have been nothing short of great in the way they teach and care for students' progression. Did you travel abroad during your years at UW-Stout? In the Summer of 2018, I traveled alone to San Isidrol, Costa Rica for a month to volunteer doing project management. In the Summer of 2019, I traveled with Kevin Anzzolin and a handful of other students to Oaxaca, Mexico to learn about business and Spanish. What has learning a language deeply meant to you? What are some soft skills that you gained from learning Spanish? Learning a language means understanding a whole new demographic of people. We are limited to what we know and the knowledge to communicate in another language opens many doors. It is about humanity, understanding, empathy, and of course, new adventures. I have learned how to effectively communicate with other cultures, my emotional intelligence has progressed, and my confidence has been nothing short of what I want it to be. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us? Spanish is a language that can open doors in many ways. There is a lot to gain from not only the language, but those who speak it. I was fortunate enough to have a solid core at UW-Stout in the Spanish. If you want to learn another language, I would recommend taking Spanish courses at Stout. Tell us a little about yourself. I graduated in the three-year program from UW-Stout in the Spring of 2020, with a degree in Psychology and a Minor in Spanish. I am currently getting my M.A in School Counseling at UW-Stout. Tell us about your experience at UW-Stout. I was very involved during my Undergraduate career. I was in Stoutward Bound as a Mentee and Mentor, Latinos Unidos, Psychology Club, Psi Chi, MSS, McNair Program, HSSO, and Winter in the Midwest Program. Since I was involved in various groups, I really enjoyed making connections with students and faculty of different cultural backgrounds. Why did you choose to become a Spanish Minor? I am a native Spanish speaker, but since I was born and grew up in the U.S, I wanted to expand my Spanish professionally and academically. I struggled with the language grammar and speaking it professionally, so I wanted to work in my native language. Did you travel abroad during your years at UW-Stout? In the Summer of 2019, I traveled alone to Zacatecas, Mexico. I had an internship as a Solving Learning Problems Teacher. I got to practice my Spanish and my vocabulary expanded. What has learning a language deeply meant to you? What are some soft skills that you gained from learning Spanish? Learning new words and working on my grammar in another language has helped me develop professionally. It honestly has opened doors for me since there are various jobs that need Spanish-speakers. I have gained to not only speak the language but to be able to communicate with others professionally. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us? Getting my minor in Spanish was one of the best decisions I did as a college student. It will open so many opportunities.",

Certificate completers will be empowered to enhance the lives of older adults in a changing environment as well as address related challenges in their local, state, national, and global communities. The population aged 65 and older in the United States is expected to double from 46 million to 96 million by 2060 and the population aged 80 and over is expected to triple. In Wisconsin, a 72% increase in the population aged 65 and older is projected through 2040, with 18 counties having one-third or more of their total population in this age group. Older adults are staying in the workforce longer and, in rural places like WI, more older adults are aging in place as younger individuals move elsewhere. According to the Academy for Gerontology in Higher Education, “The demand for professionals with expertise in aging is growing rapidly…The field of gerontology and aging is very diverse, offering different employment opportunities… For example, many older persons are healthy and active. Persons working with these older people might be providing educational opportunities, recreation and leisure programs,  and volunteer activities. Some older persons are frail and less active. Jobs which relate to these more vulnerable elders might be in long-term care, health care settings or agencies that deliver services to older persons. The relative newness of the field means that there are opportunities for innovative ideas, new programs and products.” The Gerontology Certificate is relevant to a wide-range of careers and job titles interested in upskilling in this area. For current students, it is most applicable to those in the following undergraduate and graduate programs at UW-Stout: Applied Social Science, Business Administration, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Criminal Justice and Rehabilitation, Dietetics, Health, Wellness and Fitness, Healthcare Administration, Human Development and Family Studies, Marriage and Family Therapy, Psychology, Rehabilitation Counseling, and Rehabilitation Services.
