Certificate completers will be empowered to enhance the lives of older adults in a changing environment as well as address related challenges in their local, state, national, and global communities. The population aged 65 and older in the United States is expected to double from 46 million to 96 million by 2060 and the population aged 80 and over is expected to triple. In Wisconsin, a 72% increase in the population aged 65 and older is projected through 2040, with 18 counties having one-third or more of their total population in this age group. Older adults are staying in the workforce longer and, in rural places like WI, more older adults are aging in place as younger individuals move elsewhere. According to the Academy for Gerontology in Higher Education, “The demand for professionals with expertise in aging is growing rapidly…The field of gerontology and aging is very diverse, offering different employment opportunities… For example, many older persons are healthy and active. Persons working with these older people might be providing educational opportunities, recreation and leisure programs,  and volunteer activities. Some older persons are frail and less active. Jobs which relate to these more vulnerable elders might be in long-term care, health care settings or agencies that deliver services to older persons. The relative newness of the field means that there are opportunities for innovative ideas, new programs and products.” The Gerontology Certificate is relevant to a wide-range of careers and job titles interested in upskilling in this area. For current students, it is most applicable to those in the following undergraduate and graduate programs at UW-Stout: Applied Social Science, Business Administration, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Criminal Justice and Rehabilitation, Dietetics, Health, Wellness and Fitness, Healthcare Administration, Human Development and Family Studies, Marriage and Family Therapy, Psychology, Rehabilitation Counseling, and Rehabilitation Services.

Property management is the administration, operation, marketing, and maintenance of real property in order to achieve the objectives of the property’s owner. Property managers are in a service business and work closely with both the owners of the properties they manage and the tenants and residents who reside and work within these properties. The field of property management is growing steadily because of three concurrent trends: (1) the simultaneous growth of the population and its requirements for space has increased the total number of all types of buildings, (2) a larger percentage of real estate is considered investment property and (3) there is increasingly wide acceptance of the fact that real estate management requires special training and education. There is a growing sophistication and professionalism in the management of both residential and commercial property. A professional property manager has to possess a diverse skill set in the areas of finance, accounting, tenant and employee relations and laws affecting these properties. The degree program is designed to prepare students for this by drawing widely from courses in the disciplines of business, management, construction, service management, retail and hospitality.

Introduction A packaging career today requires a thorough knowledge of materials, methods, design concepts, marketing, logistics, regulations, standards, test methods, environment, user interface, and machinery to develop and produce the packages that protect and preserve a product, help market the product and instruct the consumer in its proper use. UW-Stout’s Bachelor of Science degree program in Packaging prepares students for technical or management responsibilities in the packaging industry to meet these needs. The program places strong emphasis on the application of theory to strengthen problem solving abilities and challenges students by providing opportunities to solve “real” packaging industry problems in classroom/laboratory settings. The trend in the packaging industry is to hire employees who can function in more than one area at career entry. UW-Stout’s Packaging program recognizes this trend by offering the student several “emphasis” options which include course and laboratory work beyond the technical core of the program. With the quantity and variety of products produced in the world, it is easy to understand that packaging is a dynamic multibillion dollar industry in need of well-educated professionals. Graduates of the program are positioned advantageously for entry into the expanding and evolving packaging industry, as well as for further studies in the field of packaging.

Introduction The Bachelor of Science degree program in Manufacturing Engineering is designed to prepare engineers as experts in the production process, from design through manufacturing. As a team member, the manufacturing engineer works with other professionals in the design of products, particularly from the point of view of the efficiency of production. They are responsible for selecting the right materials for various product applications and for determining methods used in processing raw materials into finished products. Using computers, they design and control automated systems capable of rapidly making the product. Manufacturing Engineers are part of the company’s management team and make important decisions regarding production planning, inventory, scheduling and quality. Through intensive hands-on laboratory experience, which is the heart of UW-Stout’s teaching strategy, the program emphasizes application of theory to solution of real world problems. Manufacturing Engineering students learn modern production tools, such as computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), robotics, programmable logic controllers, computer simulation of production environment and modern manufacturing management techniques. Students have opportunities to function as members of production teams as they practice concurrent product design, material selection, appropriate manufacturing method selection, and automated production systems design. The UW-Stout Manufacturing Engineering degree is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. It is the only nationally accredited manufacturing engineering degree in Wisconsin. There are many opportunities for cooperative learning and internship experiences with regional companies, providing industrial experience and that extra “edge” when applying for jobs upon graduation.

Students from a wide range of academic experiences are encouraged to apply and have successfully completed the college’s requirements. Honors Units Honors College students complete eight honors units during their time at Stout. Honors units include an exciting variety of course offerings each semester, study abroad opportunities, and Honors Contracts. Courses: We have a rich variety of courses in every general education category. Students earn general education credits by taking honors courses in place of regular classes. Students read primary source materials rather than textbooks and discussion-based classes are centered on important questions. Students must earn a grade of B or better in a course in order to earn one honors unit. A three credit course will count as one honors unit. Once in a student’s career, a four or five credit course will earn two honors units, with a grade of B or better. Contracts: Honors College students must complete at least one Honors Contract prior to graduation. Successful completion of a contract earns a student one honors unit. To complete a contract, students meet with a faculty mentor to design and accomplish a project that interests them and that adds depth or breadth to their study. Students work with their mentor to complete a substantial project equivalent to approximately 60 hours of work. The student may complete no more than two Honors Contracts in a single academic area. Capstone: The Honors Capstone is a two-unit option for senior-level students. This is a major interdisciplinary research project that may build upon a capstone in the major. It requires at least 120 hours of work. Capstone projects are encouraged but not required. Study Abroad Opportunities: Students who study abroad for a semester, summer session or WinTerM, and receive a B or better in at least one course of study, will earn one honors unit. Students who study abroad for a full year, and earn B or better in at least one course per semester abroad, will receive two honors units. Study abroad is encouraged but not required. Honors Colloquia Each semester all honors students in the college consider an issue and read a related text. Readings are done independently and a date is set for the whole of the Honors College student body to meet to discuss the topic in small groups. Members of the faculty facilitate the small group discussions. The evening ends with each group forming a question or statement summarizing their discussions. Attendance and participation is required to maintain good standing in the Honors College. Honors Cultural Enhancement Events Honors events are designed to expand the intellectual breadth of our student body. They include trips to see plays or musical performances, nature-study trips, documentary screenings, service activities or campus speakers among others approved by the Honors College. Students are required to attend a minimum of one enhancement event per year. Transfer Students Transfer students are encouraged to set up an appointment and meet with the directors to determine eligibility for Honors College and suitability of honors courses and options towards the completion of their majors.", "required_courses": ""},

It is both creative and technical, incorporating text and images, used in marketing, communications, packaging, entertainment and sales. Known as Graphic Arts in the past, the field includes design, photography, printing, publishing, packaging, digital imaging, and digital media. Graphic Communications is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, with thousands of companies employing nearly a million people in a variety of challenging technical, creative, and professional occupations. UW-Stout’s Bachelor of Science Degree program in Graphic Communications prepares graduates to be professional leaders, managers and innovators who can deal with creative solutions for, content creation, business models, graphics workflows, and production efficiencies. The industry is large, inclusive and diverse, offering many opportunities for professional growth, innovation, entrepreneurship, career reinvention, creativity, and income growth. Our GCOM alumni are industry leaders throughout the U.S. and internationally. Through extensive hands-on learning experiences in a laboratory environment, the program addresses the skills and understanding necessary for student success in the global media marketplace. A strong emphasis is placed on the application of theory and laboratory experience to solve real-world problems. This program prepares leaders to respond aggressively to the needs of the marketplace; to apply research and theory to the development of marketable media products and services using efficient processes; and to lead in the development of projects with an awareness of the realities of the manufacturing process, cost, environment and needs of the customer and society.

The digitization of communications has created a fundamental switch that places technology at the heart of the process of marketing communications. New careers are emerging, and few people possess the required educational background to thrive in this new field. Digital marketing technology falls broadly into the field of “Informatics,” which is the study of how users and systems interact to accomplish goals. The program takes a multidisciplinary approach featuring content, design, development, and distribution. The heart of the curriculum is in areas of web technology and enterprise technology systems. Courses in software and web applications, marketing, design, production, and analytics provide a cross-disciplinary approach to prepare students for a broad range of careers where the job titles are just emerging and will be constantly changing and growing in the foreseeable future. Businesses realize the importance of hiring people who understand both process and technology, which results in a hot job market where talent is limited, jobs are abundant, and salaries are high.  This program prepares students for this job market and to grow as it changes.

The degree includes concentrations in Economic, History and Politics, Sociology and Anthropology, and Social Studies Education. The discipline-focused concentrations provide students with 1) social science theoretical perspectives, 2) a solid knowledge base in the social sciences and history, 3) the ability to apply critical thinking skills to creatively solve practical problems in the social, economic and political arenas, and 4) strong leadership and interpersonal skills in an increasingly diverse and changing workforce. These concentrations provide both social science theoretical perspectives and a solid foundation in social science knowledge, allowing students to apply critical and creative thinking skills to successfully problem solve in their future employment fields. Upon completion of their Applied Social Science degree, students will have skills in data collection, evaluation and analysis, presentation, and problem solving. The program is interdisciplinary and provides breadth of knowledge through coursework in the areas of economics, history, political science, geography, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. It offers depth of knowledge by giving students the opportunity to select a concentration in an area of social science with additional, upper-level courses. It also offers students an opportunity to enhance their broad knowledge in the social sciences through completion of a complementary applied minor or by completing additional applied coursework, in preparation for employment in areas such as environmental analysis, global studies, human resources and other services. Students in the Economics, History and Politics, and Sociology and Anthropology concentrations must earn a minimum grade of 2.0 or “C” in all professional core and social science concentration courses. For students who are interested in teaching, the Social Studies Teaching concentration leads to grades 4-12 licensure in Wisconsin. Students will gain an understanding of the foundations of teaching, classroom management, inclusion of student with diverse needs and learning styles, reading instruction, and assessment. They will also gain content knowledge in the social sciences (geography, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, and psychology) and history and will be placed in area schoools as student teachers. Students in the Social Studies Teaching concentration must earn a cumulative GPA of 2.75 for graduation. Courses marked with an asterisk* require a grade point of 2.0 (“C”) or better. Courses in which a student earns less than the required 2.0 must be retaken and at least a 2.0 earned prior to student teaching.
