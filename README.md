## What is a RAG

## Data
For this project, a major section of the work went into collecting and processing the data. To do this we utilized Beautifulsoup, response, and Selenium for webscraping the UW-Stout bulletin. We collected several types of data which was uitlized by the RAG, and seperated for the purposes of embedding. Data collection for programs was non-trivial due to inconsitent website layout and inconsistent program requirements.
