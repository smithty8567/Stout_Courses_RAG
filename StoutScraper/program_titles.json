Honors Units Honors College students complete eight honors units during their time at Stout. Honors units include an exciting variety of course offerings each semester, study abroad opportunities, and Honors Contracts. Courses: We have a rich variety of courses in every general education category. Students earn general education credits by taking honors courses in place of regular classes. Students read primary source materials rather than textbooks and discussion-based classes are centered on important questions. Students must earn a grade of B or better in a course in order to earn one honors unit. A three credit course will count as one honors unit. Once in a student’s career, a four or five credit course will earn two honors units, with a grade of B or better. Contracts: Honors College students must complete at least one Honors Contract prior to graduation. Successful completion of a contract earns a student one honors unit. To complete a contract, students meet with a faculty mentor to design and accomplish a project that interests them and that adds depth or breadth to their study. Students work with their mentor to complete a substantial project equivalent to approximately 60 hours of work. The student may complete no more than two Honors Contracts in a single academic area. Capstone: The Honors Capstone is a two-unit option for senior-level students. This is a major interdisciplinary research project that may build upon a capstone in the major. It requires at least 120 hours of work. Capstone projects are encouraged but not required. Study Abroad Opportunities: Students who study abroad for a semester, summer session or WinTerM, and receive a B or better in at least one course of study, will earn one honors unit. Students who study abroad for a full year, and earn B or better in at least one course per semester abroad, will receive two honors units. Study abroad is encouraged but not required. Honors Colloquia Each semester all honors students in the college consider an issue and read a related text. Readings are done independently and a date is set for the whole of the Honors College student body to meet to discuss the topic in small groups. Members of the faculty facilitate the small group discussions. The evening ends with each group forming a question or statement summarizing their discussions. Attendance and participation is required to maintain good standing in the Honors College.

In Wisconsin, a 72% increase in the population aged 65 and older is projected through 2040, with 18 counties having one-third or more of their total population in this age group. Older adults are staying in the workforce longer and, in rural places like WI, more older adults are aging in place as younger individuals move elsewhere. According to the Academy for Gerontology in Higher Education, “The demand for professionals with expertise in aging is growing rapidly…The field of gerontology and aging is very diverse, offering different employment opportunities… For example, many older persons are healthy and active. Persons working with these older people might be providing educational opportunities, recreation and leisure programs,  and volunteer activities. Some older persons are frail and less active. Jobs which relate to these more vulnerable elders might be in long-term care, health care settings or agencies that deliver services to older persons. The relative newness of the field means that there are opportunities for innovative ideas, new programs and products.” The Gerontology Certificate is relevant to a wide-range of careers and job titles interested in upskilling in this area. For current students, it is most applicable to those in the following undergraduate and graduate programs at UW-Stout: Applied Social Science, Business Administration, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Criminal Justice and Rehabilitation, Dietetics, Health, Wellness and Fitness, Healthcare Administration, Human Development and Family Studies, Marriage and Family Therapy, Psychology, Rehabilitation Counseling, and Rehabilitation Services.
